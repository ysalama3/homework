1) Absolute vs Relative Paths
Starting from /Users/amanda/data/, which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory, which is /Users/amanda?

1.    No: . stands for the current directory.
2.    No: / stands for the root directory.
3.    No: Amanda’s home directory is /Users/amanda.
4.    No: this goes up two levels, i.e. ends in /Users.
5.    Yes: ~ stands for the user’s home directory, in this case /Users/amanda.
6.    No: this would navigate into a directory home in the current directory if it exists.
7.    Yes: unnecessarily complicated, but correct.
8.    Yes: shortcut to go back to the user’s home directory.
9.    Yes: goes up one level.

   4-Yes: ../backup refers to /Users/backup.

3)
   1-No: pwd is not the name of a directory.
   2- Yes: ls without directory argument lists files and directories in the current directory.
